      <div class="explanation">
        <p>96% of online deepfake videos are porn. To this day, it is still possible to create non-consensual deepfake porn. Women are often targeted by this sexual offence. It involves stealing their identity by using their faces without permission, leading to objectification and a lack of regard for their well-being. It is hard to recover from the reputational harm this can cause. Weâ€™re seeing the objectification, dehumanisation and complete disregard of female lives.</p>
        <p>Deepfake AI software makes this possible, and it's not even that hard to use.</p>
        <p>This project criticizes this problem and the AI that is allowing the creation of deepfake porn. We should be looking at this as a threat, a threat that is so significant that it should be on the news so everyone is aware. It's a threat that is facing us today and ruining many women's lives.</p>
